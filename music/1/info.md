# 🍪 What This Page Does

This page is a fully‑automatic music radio powered by the massive public library at **Archive.org**. You don’t need to know anything about coding or how the page works behind the scenes — this description is here to explain, in simple terms, what the page *does* and how it behaves while you use it.

## 🎧 What the Radio Actually Is

Camcookie Archive Radio is an online music player that pulls audio from Archive.org based on whatever you search for. It works like a radio station that you control with a few simple buttons. You type in a word or phrase, and the radio finds audio files related to it — songs, recordings, mixes, or anything else that Archive.org has stored.

Once it starts playing, the radio keeps going automatically. It loads new tracks, switches to the next one when the current track ends, and never stops unless you tell it to.

---

## 🔍 Search Bar (Top Right)

At the top of the page, you’ll see a search bar.  
This is where you type what you want to listen to.

Examples:

- `jazz`
- `lofi`
- `video game music`
- `classical`
- `random`

When you press **Go**, the page reloads with a new URL that includes your search term. The radio then uses that term to find audio on Archive.org.

## 🎵 Now Playing Display

Right under the warnings, you’ll see a box that shows:

- The title of the track currently playing  
- Or the identifier if no title is available  
- Or “Nothing playing” if the radio hasn’t started yet  

This updates automatically every time a new track loads.

---

## ▶️ Audio Player

Below the Now Playing box is the actual audio player.  
It shows:

- A timeline  
- Volume controls  
- Play/pause  
- And the audio file that’s currently loaded  

Even though the browser’s audio player is visible, the **real control** comes from the custom buttons below it.

---

## 🎚 Custom Radio Controls

You get four main buttons:

### ✅ **Play / Pause**
Starts the radio or pauses the current track.  
The icon switches between a play symbol and a pause symbol depending on what the audio is doing.

### ✅ **Skip**
Jumps immediately to the next track in the queue.

### ✅ **Replay Last**
Replays the previous track you listened to.

### ✅ **Share**
Opens a small popup showing a link you can send to someone else.  
When they open the link, the radio will start with the exact same track you were listening to.

---

## 🔁 Endless Playback

The radio never runs out of music.

- When a track ends, the next one plays automatically  
- When the queue gets low, the page fetches more results from Archive.org  
- This continues forever  

You can literally leave it running all day.

---

## 🔗 Share Box

When you click **Share**, a full‑screen white box appears with:

- A link to the current track  
- A button to close the box  
- A note that the feature is still being improved  

This lets you send someone a direct link to the exact audio you’re listening to.

---

## 🌐 Archive.org Integration

All music comes from **Archive.org**, a huge public library of audio files.  
Camcookie Music does **not** control what appears or plays — the radio simply searches Archive.org and streams whatever matches your search term.

That’s why the page includes a warning:  
you might hear anything.
