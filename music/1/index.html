    <h2>🍪 What Camcookie Archive Radio Does</h2>
    <p>
      Camcookie Archive Radio is an online radio that streams audio from Archive.org based on whatever you search for.
      Type something into the search bar and the radio automatically finds matching audio and begins playing.
    </p>

    <h3>🎧 What the Radio Is</h3>
    <p>
      Think of it as your own custom radio station. You choose a topic, artist, or keyword, and the radio streams audio
      from Archive.org. It keeps going forever, loading new tracks as you listen.
    </p>

    <h3>🔍 Search Bar</h3>
    <p>
      At the top of the page is a search bar. Enter anything — “jazz”, “lofi”, “classical”, or anything else — and press
      Go. The radio reloads with your search and starts playing matching audio instantly.
    </p>

    <h3>🎵 Now Playing</h3>
    <p>
      A Now Playing box shows the title of the current track. It updates automatically whenever a new track begins.
    </p>

    <h3>▶️ Player Controls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Play / Pause</strong> — Start or stop the music</li>
      <li><strong>Skip</strong> — Jump to the next track</li>
      <li><strong>Replay Last</strong> — Play the previous track again</li>
      <li><strong>Share</strong> — Get a link to the exact track you're listening to</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔁 Endless Playback</h3>
    <p>
      The radio never stops. When a track ends, the next one starts automatically. New tracks are fetched in the
      background so the music keeps flowing.
    </p>

    <h3>🔗 Share Box</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking Share opens a box with a link you can send to someone else. When they open it, the radio starts with the
      same track you were listening to.
    </p>

    <h3>🌐 Archive.org Audio</h3>
    <p>
      All audio comes from Archive.org — a massive public library of sound. Camcookie Music does not control what plays;
      the radio simply streams whatever matches your search.
    </p>

    <h3>✅ Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Camcookie Archive Radio is a search‑powered radio that streams audio from Archive.org with endless playback,
      custom controls, a share system, and a simple access gate. Just search, press play, and enjoy.
    </p>
