  <h2>🍪 What Camcookie Archvie Radio Does</h2>

  <p>
    Camcookie Archvie Radio is an online radio that plays music from Archive.org based on whatever you search for.
    Just type something into the search bar and the radio will find audio related to it and start playing automatically.
  </p>

  <h3>🎧 What the Radio Is</h3>
  <p>
    Think of it like a custom radio station. You choose a topic, artist, or keyword, and the radio
    streams audio from Archive.org. It keeps playing forever, automatically loading new tracks as
    you listen.
  </p>

  <h3>🔍 Search Bar</h3>
  <p>
    At the top of the page is a search bar. Type anything you want to listen to — like “jazz”,
    “lofi”, or “classical” — and press Go. The radio reloads with your search and starts playing
    matching audio.
  </p>

  <h3>🎵 Now Playing</h3>
  <p>
    A box shows the title of the current track. It updates every time a new song starts.
  </p>

  <h3>▶️ Player Controls</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Play / Pause</strong> — Start or stop the music</li>
    <li><strong>Skip</strong> — Jump to the next track</li>
    <li><strong>Replay Last</strong> — Play the previous track again</li>
    <li><strong>Share</strong> — Get a link to the exact track you're listening to</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔁 Endless Playback</h3>
  <p>
    The radio never stops. When a track ends, the next one starts automatically. New tracks are
    fetched in the background so the music keeps going.
  </p>

  <h3>🔗 Share Box</h3>
  <p>
    Clicking Share opens a box with a link you can send to someone else. When they open it, the
    radio starts with the same track you were listening to.
  </p>
  <h3>🌐 Archive.org Audio</h3>
  <p>
    All music comes from Archive.org — a huge public library of audio. Camcookie Music does not
    control what plays. The radio simply streams whatever matches your search.
  </p>

  <h3>✅ Summary</h3>
  <p>
    This page is a search‑powered radio that streams audio from Archive.org with endless playback,
    custom controls, a share system, and a simple access gate. Just search, press play, and enjoy.
